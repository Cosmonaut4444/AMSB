udk_Cheat_Division_Templates_via_Decisions_desc: "You can add Division Templates without visiting wiki or spending Army XP.\n\nDon't forget that your Army Doctrines matter a lot, so it's suggested to adjust templates to your preferances.\n\nTemplates will be very basic, no flame tank or SPG or TD or other Niche Units, in order to reduce seperate production lines.\nYou can easily modify templates.\n\nAlso Templates are targeted to Single Player (Expert AI), though you can use some of them in MP as well. No template here has Meta 42W or 44W.\n\nThere's usually 3 variants of Divisions;\n--Cheap\n--Cost Effective\n--Expensive\n\nSome variants cost effectiveness could depend on long term usage (such as L.Tank Garrison Division with High initial IC cost, but long term more IC and Manpower cost effectiveness.)\nDecisions are repeatable after 1 day.\n\n§RWARNING:§!\nIf you don't have necessary technology for Units such as Mech or Marines, That Division's details will show everything related to that unit wrong. Researching necessary tech will fix this.You can see which tech you missing via hovering on Red exclamation mark in Equipment Button inside that template."
